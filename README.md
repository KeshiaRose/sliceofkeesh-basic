# Hello, and welcome

This is a basic HTML starter project you can build on however you like.

## What's in this project?

`index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site.

`style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

`script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
